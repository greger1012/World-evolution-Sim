# World Evolution Sim

An interactive **world-scale evolution simulation** — organisms adapting over deep time across varied environments, with rich, descriptive biology rather than a toy demo.

> **Early work in progress.** This repository is far from complete. What you can run today is a foundation: a stratified globe, regional biomass patches, and time controls. The fuller evolution system — detailed organisms, selection pressures, and large-scale environmental diversity — is still under active design and development.

## Vision

The long-term goal is a simulation where evolution feels **deep and readable**:

- **Complex evolution mechanics** — traits, populations, and lineages changing under selection, mutation, and ecological pressure, described in enough detail to follow *why* a lineage succeeds or fails
- **Environments at scale** — many regions and biomes (climate, resources, hazards, and spatial structure) that shape what can live where
- **World-level interaction** — zoom from a planetary view into local patches, watching global patterns emerge from local dynamics
- **Descriptive complexity** — not just abstract numbers; the sim should make evolutionary outcomes understandable through clear state, history, and environmental context

The current build scaffolds the **globe / region / time** layer that those systems will sit on. Expect the engine, data model, and UI to grow substantially as the evolution and environment layers land.

## What’s here now

- **Core simulation engine** (`@evo-world-sim/core`) — region state, patch grids, speed multipliers, pause/resume
- **Web UI** (`@evo-world-sim/web`) — Vite + Canvas globe and regional patch views
- **Desktop shell** (`@evo-world-sim/desktop`) — Electron wrapper around the web client
- **npm workspaces** — shared TypeScript packages with a single install at the repo root

## Tech stack

## Project layout

```
World-evolution-Sim/
├── packages/core/     # Simulation engine (regions, patches, time controls)
├── apps/web/          # Vite web client + canvas UI
└── apps/desktop/      # Electron desktop entry
```

## Quick start

**Requirements:** Node.js 18+ and npm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/greger1012/World-evolution-Sim.git
cd World-evolution-Sim
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

The web app starts via Vite (default: [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173)).

### Desktop (optional)

With the web dev server running:

```bash
npm run dev:desktop
```

Or use the workspace scripts in `package.json` to run web and Electron together.

## How to use the current UI

1. Watch the **stratified globe** update as the simulation runs.
2. Use the **speed** dropdown to accelerate or slow time.
3. **Pause / Resume** to freeze the world state.
4. **Click a globe sector** to inspect that region’s local biomass patch; return with the Globe control.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run build` | Build core, then the web app |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite web client |
| `npm run dev:desktop` | Run web + Electron together |

## Status

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Globe / regions / time controls | Early prototype |
| Biomass patch view | Early prototype |
| Organism / trait / lineage model | Planned |
| Detailed environments & biomes | Planned |
| Selection, mutation, speciation | Planned |

Feedback and contributions can wait until the core evolution model is further along; the public surface will keep changing.
